Version .01		First Semi-working alpha code

[No comments, internal alpha..Just getting the system to work =) ]

Version .02 Public Alpha

Can't resolve the ObjC and Perl dynamic loading problems, so I've moved to
a staticly linked DBI+DBD+Perl5 for my testing.  So far most things work
excluding anything returning data from the database and anything doing with
blobs.
