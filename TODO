Things I'm going to do some day:


* Get around to fixing Makefile.PL to make the Makefile correct until then
	it is just a BLANK perl program and Makefile is generated by myself.

* Create a working fetch routine.

* Clean up and document this beast

* Get help on fixing Perl5.x or my software to correctly beable to do
	dynamic loading of ObjC code.
